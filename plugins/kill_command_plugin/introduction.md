# Kill Command Plugin

#### This plugin is a Russian Roulette style plugin developed based on **MCDReforged**
#### When playing, it's recommended to remove armor and other protective gear, and hold a Totem of Undying in hand. After setting the probability and damage, when a player types `!!kill` in chat, there will be a chance (based on the configured probability) for the server to inflict the configured damage on the player.
##### Configuration file is stored at `MCDR directory/config/kill.json`
